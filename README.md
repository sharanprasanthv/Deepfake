Abstract: 
Deepfake technology has become a growing concern, enabling the creation of highly realistic AI-generated fake videos and images, which pose threats in misinformation, identity theft, and cybersecurity. This project, Faux Detect, focuses on developing an advanced deepfake detection model using the Celeb-DF dataset. The approach integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) and XceptionNet, leveraging ViT's powerful attention mechanism for spatial feature extraction and XceptionNet's depthwise separable convolutions for efficient deepfake classification. Additionally, Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) is used for precise face annotation, ensuring accurate detection. By combining transformer-based and CNN-based architectures, this project aims to enhance deepfake detection performance and improve robustness against adversarial manipulations.
